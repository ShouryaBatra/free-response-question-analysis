"I think chatgpt is very useful in general, although it shouldn't be used for everything. Because it's becoming so dominant in our world, teachers should teach students how to use it for school, but in a way that doesn't take away the actual learning and doesn't do the work for them. When used correctly, it can provide really good ideas, help, and a lot more that you otherwise might have not gotten."
"I think AI can be very helpful, but only if used properly"
"AI should be used as a tool but not as something that will tell others what is right and what is wrong. Since it is artificial intelligence, something created by humans, there are to be definite mistakes that will be made when providing answers to us. "
I think AI can be used in moderate usage and it’s not harmful to the brain as long as it is used with control
I think AI can be used in a positive way but we have to find a way to limit it to students due to all the plagiarism.  
Helpful
"I think AI chat bots are like a double edged sword: they can help you learn, but can also minimize your learning. When it comes to using chat bots for school, one must use it appropriately to actually learn, and using it to cheat is not optimal for their future. In my opinion, chat bots are a great invention because it allows students to learn, and cheat, and they have to decide themselves how they want to use it. "
"I think it is a useful tool that should not be something we fear. However, it is a bit problematic that people are relying solely on AI instead of using their brain, as it results in a lack of critical thinking. Also, people using AI and claiming as their own is also troublesome because it’s plagiarism. I think teachers should try to take advantage of AI and teach students how to use it in a way that helps them in their learning. Also, with things such as AI detectors it is hard to tell whether one actually used AI as they aren’t fully accurate. It’s difficult to block people from using AI, so instead they should try to use it in a way that is beneficial. Anyhow, I have hopes for the future use of AI and I can’t wait to see how it progresses!"
"Using it as a study tool is a good idea, but generating essays and other assignment along that line isn’t the best thing to do. Not only that, but AI is harmful to the environment in so many ways. "
"it shouldn’t be allowed in my opinion because it makes people less willing to think, which will hinder the future generations ability to think "
"I believe that AI can be a powerful tool, when it is used correctly. I feel that it should not be used primarily for doing school work, rather aiding along the way."
"I think AI is a great way to help study and learn material that you don’t quite understand or when you can’t get help from a real person. It’s also great for editing paragraphs or just helping with little things here and there. However, I think it is making students lazier and they now don’t feel as much pressure because they can have ai do the work for them and they can tweak it. "
"They suture the right answer but it really depends on the specific details you give the chatbox, especially in gemini if you were to ask about a history question like the corrupt bargain you would have to specify what year and who you are talking about"
AI can be beneficial but more government oversight and regulation is needed 
"Don’t like AI  because it’s ethically wrong, bad for the environment, and not useful enough to justify these things."
It is a very useful tool and an integral part of our society as we know it today although some concerns that I have over AI is that sometimes it uses personal information of other people to train itself.
"The opinions I've seen online about AI are both (In my opinion) correct and incorrect. I do agree that AI has no place in fine arts and that it's disgusting that the algorithm is being fed people's art to make soulless slop. I also agree that the fact people are using this tool to create pornographic, gory, or explicit images of others is absolutely abhorrent behavior and the people who do this (especially with children) should be put on a regsistry. But I do support the idea of AI being in STEM, as it helped me out of the trenches in my honors class for Biology, and the fact that one AI was also used to identify breast cancer before it became fully developed, and the fact it has many applications in helping people with disabilities. Honestly—I'm tired of people who act like they're the shit because they ""don't use AI"" in STEM or Academia. And I'm also tired of people who think they're the shit because they use AI frequently. Both parties are equally horrible, but at least people who don't use AI still have an ounce of humanity in them. We're human. we make flaws, and I'm speaking as someone who first touched ChatGPT to grade my essay. AI's a clunky tool. There's a lot of hypocrites who stand for ""Anti-AI"" but then go to use filters to see what they look like in a BRATZ doll style, ask ChatGPT to write Love Island scripts using their enemies, and also use chatbots like Character.AI. You're anti-AI until it's a silly trend? Regarding the chatbots, I could do a whole section on them as someone who used them to develop characters and OCs. But overrall, all I have to say is that albeit AI's a great tool, the way most people are using it—academic dishonesty, using it to create images—it makes me worried for the future state of the world, especially with the fact it literally pollutes the earth. For me? AI's cool as long as it just stays in the lane where it was made. You belong in STEM. nowhere else. My main problem with AI is that it's just people are using it for the wrong reasons. It's not AI's fault that there are several deepfaked and fake images of women and children in disgusting positions, it's not AI's fault several relationships got broken up because one partner left the other for Gojo on character ai, but our own. We were given a tool with golden opportunities, and as society usually does, we fucked it over."
I think it can be a great resource for studying or personalizing one’s education but not good in terms of creating work for school. I personally have only used chat gpt only for asking questions about things I wasn’t sure with and I mostly check the info before using it.
"I think AI in education cave be beneficial as a study tool, but it can be misused when the user asks for the chat bot to generate the product itself. This takes away the point of real life skills as in the real world, you may not have access to AI all the time."
"I think AI can be helpful in a lot of situations, but not all"
"i think it can be useful, but that we shouldn't use it all the time or trust it completely."
I think it’s very helpful. I know my friends never understand what their teachers teach because they aren’t good at explaining so they ask AI to help them explain and they understand the topic a lot better. Personally I think AI teaches better than actual teachers. 
i think it's useful and that we shouldn't ignore even if does have its downsides. as ai becomes bigger and bigger it makes sense that we should take advantage of how it can used whilst still not using it for ervhthing
"I think that AI use is bad in all ways, not only does it waste water, but it ruins real art and all that surrounds expression. Not to mention the impact it has on learning. I don’t blame students for using because I understand why they are. Kids are worked to the bone and if they can use AI to do it, it makes sense that they would. I don’t think we should be using AI at all"
"AI should never be able to replace human teachers. And, the environmental damage is so awful, using AI itself is becoming such a big problem for future generations. If one needs help with homework or studying, most schools offer free tutoring, and there are many online resources available to them. "
I would like to see the world work with AI rather than against it. For example in classes like Lit using AI to improve things/proofread even if the work is mostly your own.
"AI is good when it is used as a search engine. AI provides direct, easy to understand, and clear answers to any question. As long as users aren’t directly copying AI and using as their own, AI is pretty nice."
"As the world is getting more technical and ai is being integrated into more everyday tasks, I believe it is important that everyone learns how to use AI and how it works."
Really helpful
"It is a great tool when used properly, and the possibilities of it are endless."
"I believe that AI should be treated as a developing tool, not a furnished encyclopedia or something to replace our own thoughts. I don’t see why we shouldn’t enhance our education with the help of ever developing AIs. However, I draw the line where if we incorporate AI, there needs to also be human lead teaching on how it should be used. The danger of AI within the scope of education is that students start using it to think and learn for them. Students should use AI as an extra tool under the conditions that they use it to enhance and amplify their knowledge and thought and that they are proactive in checking the AI’s work. Teachers (math teachers for instance) can use AI to complete repetitive tasks such as generating problems, as time on these tedious tasks could instead be replaced with developing their curriculum or doing other more creative things as they see fit."
"I think that it’s very helpful and I use it all the time in my daily life. I love that it can give you suggestions and feedback on your writing. It can also simplify definitions so it’s easier to understand. Overall, my experience has been amazing!"
People are yo reliant on it
I think it’s better off for gooning as it’s sooo fun i bust buckets worth out every time
It’s super useful
it very good very good
"I think AI isn't going to replace humans, but those who know how to use AI better will replace those who don't. To me AI is almost like an advanced calculator or search engine and serves as a tool for humans to use. Compared to a lot of my peers I think I haven't been using AI enough, so hopefully I can try using it more to learn extra."
AI can benefit a lot of people and impact how they learn and interpret things.
"I think that it is a good tool to study or review or understand concepts, but should not be doing your actual assignments for you. "
"I think that you should never use AI to just do your work for you. I use it as a starting point sometimes but I always end up writing my own thing. I know people in my history class who would just brainlessly submit stuff from AI without eve double checking it which is bad, because they always ended up doing badly since AI makes stuff up sometimes. I think its a great resource but I would never use to get a quick break or to just not do work."
Unfair
"They can be very helpful sometimes. Looking for reference-material, study guides, etc. However it is very easy to use it to cheat."
"AI use is always a spectrum. AI is definitely a tool, but when used incorrectly, it can be a hazard and/or harmful. "
I think it is very useful but also could be used to restrict human creativity. For example instead of brainstorming things by yourself you could just ask ChatGPT 
"I think AI shouldn't be used to do thinking for you, but uses outside of that like giving you starting ideas or practice problems can be helpful."
Has a lot of potential if used properly - for example using it to study or explain concepts that i don't understand 
I think that there’s a lot that can be done to improve the quality of AI responses because often they’re over complicated and don’t go to the point.
"I think a lot of people are messed up and lose knowledge potential because of AI, because lazy peers use it as a way to escape work, but it is a pretty handy resource."
Why is it not ranged from 6-7 6’7 😈😈😈😈👴🏿👴🏿👴🏿
"In my experience, AI has been one of the strongest tools I’ve used to improve on skills. I pretty much only use it for breaking down math problems and helping me troubleshoot code. Although I do believe it’s easy to misuse AI, I think that the benefits strongly outweigh the negatives."
pretty cool and is an amazing tutor
"I don’t know much about AI as it’s not something I use very often however I do realise that there can be issues with people using AI to do the work and then using a humanifying tool to make it sound more human like, thus creating a bigger issue as AI bots who can tell what is AI or not are not able to see past this at times, thus impacting the education system."
Helped with my development and growth and opened doors I would not have known to exist without AI. Helped me learn beyond the limits of a traditional education
"I don’t believe it should be used because everything you do with ai for education is something that helps with critical thinking skills, and something people should practice."
"I think when used responsibly AI can be very helpful. Something I don’t like about AI is AI art, as it’s misleading and can take away from real artists."
"I think that AI is really impacting the education system because even though I use it, I have realized how much work that I don’t understand since I trusted AI with assignments."
I think it’s fine at long as the work isnt fully plagiarized 
should be used to help learn not help cheat
I really like it
It should not be allowed on the learner’s end because it is just a pattern recognition model that sometimes makes up information. It is untrustworthy and takes all of the elements of learning from a person. A person who uses ai has it think for them instead of for themselves
can be used for finding sources or other small tasks but not actual work like essay 
"Can be used to explain concepts and help review, but shouldn’t be used to do the task for you"
It will get harder for teachers to know if a students work is authentic
Keep AI as a tool to use to advance the world no need to limit its use for students who could one day use to to build a company 
"I think its the inevitable future of education, and theres nothing you can do about it,"
It's okay when used correctly. I use it to make me study guides and practice tests a lot and I think that is an appropriate usage but I know a lot of people who use it to do all their assignments.
"Shouldn’t be used for schoolwork, should be used as little as possible"
"For me, personally, AI should be used as little as possible. Though I am a student and many of my peers misuse AI during school, I try not ti as much as possible because I know that learning excersises and grows my brain and thinking capacity. I want to be successful when I grow up so I try to authentically do my work however much I can to gain experience in different subjects and fields and actually understand concepts rather than use AI to solve problems for me. I also just learned that AI has a very large negative impact on the environment, and that the super computers used to run these codes and systems use a great amount of energy, powered by fossil fuels, so I really don't like that so many people are using AI nowadays. Yes, there are many pros that follow AI, like personalized study guides and more efficient ways of getting work done, but while in an educational environment, using AI to assist you in assignments is achieving almost the opposite of actually learning concepts needed in one's future."
"destruction of enviroment isnt enough to justify convenience, concerned that it falls way too much into convenience culture"
"I think it’s helpful for specific uses, but it’s definitely used to an extent. In the past I’ve witnessed classmates get accused of being 100% AI, and it’s not fun for anyone."
AI is a really good tool to help you learn but sometimes it can give you false information - it will teach you the wrong thing. But AI tools are really helpful for studying for tests.
"AI is a double edged sword because it can be used as a tutor but also for cheating.
It should be taught in school how to use llms to learn (how to use ai as a personal TA/tutor). 
Assignments/homework have to be rethought to be resistant to llm cheating, just like how math had to be rethought when everyone obtained calculators. "
"Personally I don’t understand how people can trust AI to this extent. Especially because they don’t always give you the correct or accurate answer. Even when students cheat with chat gpt, they probably aren’t even getting the right answers most of the time. In general I believe it’s better to not formulate a reliance on AI, because you’ll just want to use it more and more overtime, loosing your own creative thinking. Lastly, AI is also bad for the environment."
I think AI is very fascinating and useful to many people for different reasons.
"I think that although it is a resource, it is too available and can be used harmfully very commonly."
"It isn’t very reliable and sometimes bad. For example, some people write like AI and may get accused when it isn’t used. It also makes it hard for people who don’t use it. My teacher have to implement special rules and make it harder to do stuff."
Imo I think ai kinda set the standard of creativity for ppl that heavily uses ai chatbots. And ppl this generation are def losing their ability to create original work due to the heavy reliance on ai. 
"Teachers and schools limit AI to an unfair degree, and instead of trying to understand how best to use it, they completely disallow it. This puts students at a disadvantage since AI will only continue to grow and if students are not taught to use it properly, they will be behind once they enter the real world. "
"I believe that AI is beneficial in the way that it allows students to cut down on “busy work” given to them, while also allowing them to get synopses of the information that they can read whilst inputting it in their assignments. I think that it’s also very helpful for checking for simple errors (i.e., grammatical, spelling, sentence/paragraph flow). Especially with those who have extracurriculars like sports, it is important to spend your time efficiently while also making sure you’re learning something. So while I think AI is very helpful and important, I think in a lot of cases it is abused and prevents students from learning the material they need to perform well on exams and real life applications of knowledge."
"Should be used as a tool for learning, not a replacement for homework and assignments."
It helps me when I’m stuck and is a very useful tool for school
"I believe it takes away from students ability to think for themselves which will eventually backfire on humanity as we will soon rely on AI so much that we are not able to create new solutions to our problems on our own. I know that AI becoming a major part of life today is inevitable but I hope there are sensible people who will use it wisely and in measure. 

I wish AI was never invented."
Lowk ass. Working on a solution rn tho.
"AI in education has the potential to limit students' ability of thinking on their own. AI should not completely replace human-written works. It is important to emphasize a balance between AI and human ideas if AI is being utilized, so that students do not build reliance on AI."
it’s helpful but as a guide not a tool
It can be helpful but it’s also deadly 
"AI in education has a lot of potential to make learning more personal and accessible. It’s great that students can get help anytime, and teachers can save time on routine tasks. If we use it wisely, AI can be a great tool to support both students and teachers."
"I am concerned about the potential negative affect of AI chatbots/LLMs on independent thinking. For example, I’ve heard people say that after using (for ex) ChatGPT, they can’t do the same work without it and become reliant on it. This could mean that if somebody used AI to help them read and understand an article they are setting back their reading comprehension by not putting in the work themselves. Also, despite having significantly developed in the past years and having a rapid rate of improvement, AI still hallucinates frequently. I think this is something many students may not know, and so they trust the bot blindly. This concerns me, especially if they are learning about political views or history, because they are getting a potentially biased and inaccurate world view."
It can be useful if used primarily to teach the students rather than giving the answer straight to the students.
when i said i used it for schoolwork i meant for math only and debugging/checking grammar errors. i dont believe in its use for ai art or writing. 
I think AI is really useful and can be used in good ways for education.
Love it 
I hope ai soon can generate nsfw gay nigger butt sex content so i can jerk my shit off to it and get fucked by gay dudes in my area.
I think it can be helpful but it is important for humans to be independent and not lean on AI too much.
it can be a good thing especially for studying  and breaking down concepts
"Ai is so dumb, but it helps me get ideas (I’m like the most uncreative person I know so I really need it)"
It can sometimes give the correct answers but it’s not enough info or it is sometimes from an unreliable source.
"I think AI is definitely good for helping with understanding subjects in school but shouldnt be used to do your work for you. We can't keep relying on AI for everything, because we humans are the ones that organize the world... erm idk what im saying but u totes get the point 🤪"
I like it for proofreading and that’s pretty much it. 
its helpful sometimes but not reliable
"Talking about data privacy is important fact to address,though the research analysis is better than spending huge amount of time in research publications (in time concerns)"
It has the potential to make me overtly dependent on it.
I think it does allow for cheating in school in environments ☹️😔 but I can see it being useful for students with disabilities if utilized correctly. 
"AI is an extremely powerful tool that should be leveraged in order to enhance a student's learning experience rather than nullify it. While the accuracy of their answers can be less than stellar at times, performance will improve as the technology evolves."
It good it’s my therapist!
Ai is gonna take over 
I think AI is a good tool for enhancing the learning experience but I think when people rely on it as a crutch it can heavily detract from their academic ability. I think for essays it’s really bad but for asking questions and surface level creativity (naming and titling stuff)
"AI in education is honestly really helpful. I get a better understanding of concepts as it not only gives step-by-step solutions but also gives answers to follow-up questions. I don't have to read too many articles and websites to get the answer, AI sums it up for me."
At least read the server rules before posting.
Quite useful 
A double edged sword to be used responsibly 
It's really useful for things like making flashcards and breaking down math problems catered to your needs. 
"ai can and will be helpful to people that know how to use it to improve themselves and not rely on it, however those that solely rely on ai and dont care about self improvement will only reach the max potential of the ai, not themselves, thus making things harder"
I am against it. 
"I think it’s good and helpful for students, but overused."
