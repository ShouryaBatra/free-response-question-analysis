I also agree that the fact people are using this tool to create pornographic, gory, or explicit images of others is absolutely abhorrent behavior and the people who do this (especially with children) should be put on a regsistry. But I do support the idea of AI being in STEM, as it helped me out of the trenches in my honors class for Biology, and the fact that one AI was also used to identify breast cancer before it became fully developed, and the fact it has many applications in helping people with disabilities. Honestly—I'm tired of people who act like they're the shit because they \"don't use AI\" in STEM or Academia. And I'm also tired of people who think they're the shit because they use AI frequently. Both parties are equally horrible, but at least people who don't use AI still have an ounce of humanity in them. We're human. we make flaws, and I'm speaking as someone who first touched ChatGPT to grade my essay. AI's a clunky tool. There's a lot of hypocrites who stand for \"Anti-AI\" but then go to use filters to see what they look like in a BRATZ doll style, ask ChatGPT to write Love Island scripts using their enemies, and also use chatbots like Character.AI. You're anti-AI until it's a silly trend? Regarding the chatbots, I could do a whole section on them as someone who used them to develop characters and OCs. But overrall, all I have to say is that albeit AI's a great tool, the way most people are using it—academic dishonesty, using it to create images—it makes me worried for the future state of the world, especially with the fact it literally pollutes the earth. For me? AI's cool as long as it just stays in the lane where it was made. You belong in STEM. nowhere else. My main problem with AI is that it's just people are using it for the wrong reasons. It's not AI's fault that there are several deepfaked and fake images of women and children in disgusting positions, it's not AI's fault several relationships got broken up because one partner left the other for Gojo on character ai, but our own.
